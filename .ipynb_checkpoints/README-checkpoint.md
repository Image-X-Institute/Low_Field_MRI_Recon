## Key Files

The following Jupyter notebooks were used to generate figures contained in the manuscript:
- FigA_fast_mri_sampling_experiment.ipynb: Figure 2
- FigB_fast_mri_noise_experiment_complete-R2_R4.ipynb: Figure 3,4
- FigC_phantom_experiment_plot.ipynb: Figure 5
- FigD_retro_ulf_3T_compare.ipynb: Figure 6
- FigE_prospective_recon-phantom-brain.ipynb: Figure 7

The following python files are needed to run the Jupyter notebooks:
- automap_fns.py: Code for applying AUTOMAP to k-space data.
- display_fns.py: Code for displaying images as subplots that compare various reconstruction methods.
- metrics.py: Code for calculating image reconstruction metrics such as NRMSE and SSIM.
- ulf_recon_fns.py: Code for masking fully-sampled datasets and performing IFFT and CS reconstruction.
- unrolling_fns.py: Code for applying Unrolled AI to k-space data for image reconstruction.

A requirements.txt file has been generated that details the pip packages required to run the Jupyter notebooks.
